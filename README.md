DMA OL
DMA OL is a fast and integrated tool designed for creating DMA firmware. Leveraging Vivado Cloud technology, it quickly sets up an IDE environment on the server, enabling efficient simulation and firmware creation directly from your web browserâ€”no local environment configuration required!

Current Progress
As of now, we offer a basic open-source version of DMA OL. This version supports a limited range of applications, including basic eac and other games. Advanced features, such as support for VGA and Faceit, are available in the premium version.
